# Coffee-Rust-Detection
## Description
This is a simple example of an image classifier made with Tensorflow MobilenetV2. This is used to detect if a coffee plant is either healthy or has a disease caused by a red spider mite or has rust level 1, 2, 3 or 4. In order to use the classifier you have to pay $0.75. Since this a project in progress it has a credit card for testing provided by Stripe, more of that below.

The application is mounted in a Render server. Go to this link in order to see the project https://coffee-rust-detection.onrender.com/analyze.
